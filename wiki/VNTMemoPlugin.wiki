=VNT Memo plugin=

Conver VNT memos into text files.

==Description==
On my Samsung Galaxy S, the Android application *Memo* saves the notes as _.vnt_ files.

Once you download them on your computer, you want to view them just as it would show on your phone. 
The Line Brakes in the note are preserved.

Since I haven't found any application that parses a .vnt note, I created this basic eclipse plugin to convert my .vnt memo files into text(.txt) files.

==Download the plug-in==

==Install the plugin==

#1 Shut down eclipse
#2 Copy the .jar into `eclipse\dropins\` folder
#3 Start eclipse
